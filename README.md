# Lab4 - Introduction to Classes, Objects, and Methods 🚀

This repository contains solutions for **Lab 4** from the "Introduction to Classes, Objects, and Methods" exercise at **Akademia Finansów i Biznesu Vistula**. The exercises were developed under the guidance of mgr inż. Dominik Bielecki.

## Contents 📁

- **Task1.java**  
  A program to calculate the area of a rectangle using a `RectangleArea` class with methods to get user input, compute the area, and display the result.

- **Task2.java**  
  A program simulating a `Car` object. The `Car` class includes private fields, constructors, getters, setters, and methods to simulate car delivery and sales. The main class demonstrates the use of these methods.

- **Task3.java**  
  A menu-driven program for number system conversion and arithmetic operations. It supports conversions between multiple bases (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 16) and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (using integer division) on numbers from these bases.
